# Happy-Number

Problem Statement
A happy number is defined as a number that eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the squares of its digits. If it loops endlessly, it's not happy.

## Solution Approach
Implemented two methods:
1. **Hash Set Tracking** - Simple O(log n) space solution
2. **Floyd's Cycle Detection** - Optimized O(1) space solution using slow/fast pointers

## Code Features
- Clean, documented Python implementation
- Time complexity: O(log n)
- Space complexity: O(1) for Floyd's method
